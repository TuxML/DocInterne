# Database status
## 1. Introduction

When refactoring the whole core project, we stumble upon the database part,
which provide a data set for Machine Learning algorithm.

The whole database consist in two main tables : *compilations* and
*incremental_compilations*.

**Note** : We will mark Primary Key with **bold** font and will mark Foreign Key
with *\<field_name\>*(table.field_name_origin).

The two tables tables are divided as follow :

- compilations

| Field | Meaning |
| :---: | :-----: |
| Empty |         |
|       | Empty |

- incremental_compilations

| Field | Meaning |
| :---: | :-----: |
| **_cid_incmod_**(compilations.cid) | The corresponding **cid** of a compilation made with incremental mode. |
| **_cid_origin_**(compilations.cid) | The corresponding **cid** of the compilation which resulting object file are reused to compile the **_cid_incmod_**. |
