# Database status
## 1. Introduction

When refactoring the whole core project, we stumble upon the database part,
which provide a data set for Machine Learning algorithm.

The whole database consist in two main tables : *compilations* and
*incremental_compilations*.

**Note** : We will mark Primary Key with **bold** font and will mark Foreign Key
with **_field_name_**(table.field_name_origin).

The two tables tables are divided as follow :

- compilations

| Field |  Type  | Meaning |
| :---: | :----: | :------ |
| **cid** | | The unique id of each compilation made. It stands for *c*ompilation *id*. Note that each compilation are unique, but the result can be redundant.        |
| compilation_date | | When the compilation have been made. |
| compilation_time | | How many time have elapsed during the compilation. If negative, it mainly means that the compilation failed. |
| config_file | | The configuration file used to specify the Linux kernel configuration. Present in a compressed form. |
| stdlog_file | | The standard output of the compilation, different from what was display to the user. |
| errlog_file | | The error output of the compilation, different from what was display to the user.
| output_file | | What are display to the user. |
| core_size | | The size of the compiled kernel. Will be 0 if the compilation failed. |
| compressed_size | | |
| dependencies | | |
| gcc_version | | |
| libc_version | | |
| core_used | | |
| incremental_mod | | |
| tuxml_version | | |
| git_branch | | |
| docker_image | | |
| os | | |
| distribution | | |
| distrib_version | | |
| kernel | | |
| arch | | |
| cpu | | |
| cpu_cores | | |
| cpu_freq | | |
| ram | | |
| mechanical_drive | | |

- incremental_compilations

| Field |  Type  | Meaning |
| :---: | :----: | :------ |
| **_cid_incmod_**(compilations.cid) | | The corresponding **cid** of a compilation made with incremental mode. |
| **_cid_origin_**(compilations.cid) | | The corresponding **cid** of the compilation which resulting object file are reused to compile the **_cid_incmod_**. |
