# Database status
## 1. Introduction

When refactoring the whole core project, we stumble upon the database part,
which provide a data set for Machine Learning algorithm.

The whole database consist in two main tables : *compilations* and
*incremental_compilations*.

**Note** : We will mark Primary Key with **bold** font and will mark Foreign Key
with **_field_name_**(table.field_name_origin).

The two tables tables are divided as follow :

- compilations

| Field |  Type  | Meaning |
| :---: | :----: | :------ |
| **cid** | int(11) | The unique id of each compilation made. It stands for *c*ompilation *id*. Note that each compilation are unique, but the result can be redundant.        |
| compilation_date | datetime | When the compilation have been made. |
| compilation_time | float | How many time have elapsed during the compilation. If negative, it mainly means that the compilation failed. Time is in seconds. |
| config_file | longblob | The configuration file used to specify the Linux kernel configuration. Present in a compressed form. |
| stdlog_file | longblob | The standard output of the compilation, different from what was display to the user. |
| errlog_file | longblob | The error output of the compilation, different from what was display to the user.
| output_file | longblob | What are display to the user. |
| core_size | int(11) | The size of the compiled kernel. Will be 0 if the compilation failed. Size is in (?) Byte. |
| compressed_size | text | The size of the compiled kernel, depending on the compression algorithm used. Size is in (?) Byte. |
| dependencies | longtext | (?) |
| gcc_version | varchar(32) | Version of the GCC and G++ compiler. |
| libc_version | varchar(32) | Version of the LDD linker. |
| core_used | int(11) | The number of cores used during the compilation. |
| incremental_mod | tinyint(1) | States if this compilation have been made in incremental mode. |
| tuxml_version | varchar(32) | The version of TuxML when doing this compilation. |
| git_branch | varchar(32) | (?) Always blank. |
| docker_image | varchar(32) | (?) Always blank. |
| os | varchar(32) | The system kernel on which we compile. Could be Linux, Windows, MacOS or Java. |
| distribution | varchar(32) | Assuming we are using Linux, the distribution name (e.g. debian, fedora, ...). |
| distrib_version | varchar(32) | Assuming we are using Linux, the distribution version. |
| kernel | varchar(32) | The system kernel version. |
| arch | varchar(32) | The architecture on which we are running the compilation and for which we compile (e.g. x86_x64, arm64, ...). |
| cpu | varchar(128) | The brand name of the cpu which is used for the compilation. |
| cpu_cores | int(11) | The total number of thread available for this CPU. |
| cpu_freq | varchar(32) | A sample of this cpu frequencies. |
| ram | int(11) | The ram size, in kB. |
| mechanical_drive | tinyint(1) | Determine if we are using an HDD or something else. |

- incremental_compilations

| Field |  Type  | Meaning |
| :---: | :----: | :------ |
| **_cid_incmod_**(compilations.cid) | int(11) | The corresponding **cid** of a compilation made with incremental mode. |
| **_cid_origin_**(compilations.cid) | int(11) | The corresponding **cid** of the compilation which resulting object file are reused to compile the **_cid_incmod_**. |
